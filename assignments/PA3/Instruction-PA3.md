# Instruction of PA3

## Introduction

The assignment makes use of two tools: the **parser generator** (the C++ tool is called **bison**; the Java tool is called CUP) and a **package for manipulating trees**. The output of your parser will be an **abstract syntax tree (AST)**. You will construct this AST using semantic actions of the parser generator.

## Preparation

- Read some documents: `PA3.pdf`, `Figure 1 of The Cool Reference Manual`, `bison Manual`, `README` and *`Tour of Cool Support Code`* (The C++ version of the tree package is described in it).
- Download correct version of bison (v3.8.2).
